## Development Environment 
* Visual Studio 2017<br>
* OpenCV 3.42<br>
* C++11 <br>

## Description 
* The program is written by C and C++. It includes simple windows programming <br>
(window dissolution makes the screen look like a dissolving effect)and simple <br>
image processing, capturing each frame of video and processing it customized. <br>
At present, all the processing of the code settings is random, which does not <br>
seem to work very well, but if you set the parameters yourself, the video will <br>
look interesting. <br>

## Tutorial
* Please add your video file in 
```
   config/video/
```
* Open the file
```
  config/envir_config.yml
```
* Find the line
```
  videoPath: "\\config\\video\\1.avi"

```
* Replace the ***1.avi*** with your video name .
* When it runs , you will see that your screen begins to twitch with the video,<br>
then everything will be dull. <br>
